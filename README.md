Contents: 
<ol>

<li> NDVI:<br> 
     Contains Algorithms for NDVI Map and RGB Image Creation using ORB feature matching for image matching and image alignment.<br>
     NDVI map is created by aligning NIR band with Red band. <br>
     RGB image is created using all the three bands together.
     
<li> Mass_NDVI:<br> 
     Contains algorithms for creating NDVI and RGB images for all the images in the database. 
     
<li> LoFTR_Algorithm_Image_Matching:<br>
     Contains LoFTR algorithm for image matching and alignment.
